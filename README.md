# SOTA of Deep learning based from DSM to DTM

## Introduction

En français,  Modèle numérique de surface (MNS) et Modèle numérique de terrain(MNT).

From *DSM*(Digital Surface Model) to *DTM*(Digital Terrain Model) is a  traditional topic, i.e. *DEM*(Digital Elevation Model) filtering. Among the traditional methods, the most famous method is using  progressive *TIN* (Triangular Irregular Network).

With the development of deep learning,  many methods and dataset are published, in this document, the methods and dataset is listed.

## Method

Because the input may be different, this will significantly influence the method, so the methods will be classified by the input. The input can be point cloud, DSM, DSM+Image.

### Point cloud based

Point cloud based usually  means LiDAR based, because LiDAR point cloud is accurate and with penetrability. On the other hand,  

Using deep learning, the DEM filtering  is converted into a classification problem, ground and non-ground point.
