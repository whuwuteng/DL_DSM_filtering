# SOTA of Deep learning for DSM to DTM

## Introduction

En français,  Modèle numérique de terrain(MNT) et Modèle numérique de surface (MNS).

From *DSM*(Digital Surface Model) to *DTM*(Digital Terrain Model) is a  traditional topic, i.e. *DEM*(Digital Elevation Model) filtering. The most famous method is using  progressive *TIN* (Triangular Irregular Network).

With the development of deep learning,  many methods and dataset are published, in this document, the methods and dataset is listed.
